        Veg pulao is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish made with basmati rice, mixed vegetables, and aromatic spices. It is often cooked with ingredients like peas, carrots, beans, and bell peppers, and seasoned with cumin, cloves, and bay leaves. Veg pulao is typically served as a main course or as a side dish alongside curries or raita.
