        Double Ka Meetha is a traditional Indian dessert made from bread slices soaked in a rich mixture of milk, sugar, and aromatic spices like cardamom and saffron. The bread is typically fried or toasted before being soaked, giving it a delightful texture. The dessert is often garnished with nuts such as almonds and pistachios, adding a crunchy contrast to the creamy sweetness. It is a popular treat during festive occasions and celebrations.
