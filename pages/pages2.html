        Chicken shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish made with marinated chicken that is slow-cooked on a vertical rotisserie. The chicken is typically seasoned with a blend of spices, including garlic, cumin, paprika, and turmeric. It is often served in pita bread with tahini sauce, pickles, and fresh vegetables.
