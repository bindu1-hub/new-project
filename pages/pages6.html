        Fish fry is a popular dish made by marinating fish fillets in a mixture of spices, herbs, and sometimes yogurt or lemon juice, then coating them in a seasoned flour or breadcrumb mixture before frying until golden brown and crispy. It is often served with tartar sauce, lemon wedges, and a side of salad or fries.
