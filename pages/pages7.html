        Gulab jamun is a popular Indian dessert made from deep-fried dough balls soaked in a sweet syrup flavored with cardamom, rose water, or saffron. The dough is typically made from khoya (reduced milk) or milk powder, combined with a small amount of flour and sometimes a leavening agent. The fried dough balls are then immersed in warm sugar syrup, allowing them to absorb the sweetness and become soft and juicy. Gulab jamun is often served warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts or dried fruits.
