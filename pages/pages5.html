        Mutton biryani is a rich and aromatic rice dish made with tender pieces of mutton (goat meat), basmati rice, and a blend of spices. The mutton is typically marinated in yogurt and spices before being cooked with layers of partially cooked rice, fried onions, and fresh herbs. Mutton biryani is often served with raita, salad, or boiled eggs.
