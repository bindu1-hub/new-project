        Pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients such as meats, vegetables, and herbs. The pizza is then baked at a high temperature until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted and bubbly. There are many variations of pizza, including Margherita, Pepperoni, and Veggie, among others.
