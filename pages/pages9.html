        Noodles are a versatile and popular dish made from unleavened dough that is rolled flat and cut into long, thin strips. They can be made from various types of flour, including wheat, rice, or buckwheat. Noodles can be served in a variety of ways, such as in soups, stir-fries, or cold salads, and are often accompanied by vegetables, meats, and flavorful sauces.
