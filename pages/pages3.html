        Rasmalai is a popular Indian dessert made from soft paneer (Indian cottage cheese) balls soaked in sweetened, flavored milk. The milk is typically infused with cardamom and saffron, giving it a rich aroma and taste. Rasmalai is often garnished with chopped nuts like pistachios and almonds, adding a delightful crunch to the creamy texture of the dessert.
